# Unix Utilities

This project implements simplified versions of two common Unix utilities: `look` and `rev`. These programs were developed as part of the CS537 course project on Unix utilities.

## my-look

`my-look` is a utility that searches for lines starting with a given string in a file or standard input. It mimics the functionality of the Unix `look` command with the following features:

- Case-insensitive string matching
- Support for file input or standard input
- Command-line options for version info (-V) and usage help (-h)

## my-rev

`my-rev` is a utility that reverses the characters of each line from a file or standard input. It replicates the basic functionality of the Unix `rev` command:

- Line-by-line reversal
- Support for file input or standard input
- Command-line options for version info (-V) and usage help (-h)

Both utilities are written in C and demonstrate fundamental Unix programming concepts, including file I/O, command-line argument parsing, and string manipulation.
