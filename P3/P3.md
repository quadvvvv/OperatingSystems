# xv6 Custom Round-Robin Scheduler

This project implements a Compensated Round-Robin (CRR) scheduler for the xv6 operating system. The CRR scheduler extends the basic Round-Robin algorithm by introducing variable time-slice lengths for processes and compensation for blocked processes.

## Key Features

1. **Variable Time-Slice Lengths**: Each process can have a different time-slice length, specified in timer ticks.
2. **Process Compensation**: Processes are compensated for time spent blocked, receiving extra CPU time upon waking.
3. **New System Calls**: Implemented `setslice()`, `getslice()`, `fork2()`, and `getpinfo()` to manage and monitor the custom scheduler.
4. **Improved Sleep Mechanism**: Modified the sleep implementation to avoid unnecessary wake-ups and ensure proper compensation.

## Implementation Highlights

- **proc.c**: Core scheduler logic, including process management and the main scheduling algorithm.
- **sysproc.c**: System call implementations for the new scheduler-related functions.
- **schedtest.c**: A test program that creates child processes with specified time slices and reports on their execution.
- **loop.c**: A simple CPU-bound program used for testing the scheduler behavior.

## Why Only These Files?

This repo focuses on the core files that demonstrate the custom scheduler implementation. These four files contain the key logic and modifications necessary to showcase the CRR scheduler's functionality. Other xv6 files, while modified, are not included to keep the focus on the main scheduling logic and testing mechanisms.

## What I've Done

1. Implemented the CRR scheduling algorithm in `proc.c`, modifying the existing xv6 scheduler.
2. Added new fields to the `proc` structure to track time slices, compensation ticks, and other scheduling-related information.
3. Created new system calls in `sysproc.c` to interface with the custom scheduler.
4. Developed `schedtest.c` to demonstrate and test the new scheduler's behavior, including process creation with custom time slices and compensation reporting.
5. Created `loop.c` as a simple, controllable workload for scheduler testing.
6. Modified the sleep mechanism to work correctly with the new scheduling system, ensuring proper process blocking and compensation.

This project demonstrates proficiency in operating systems concepts, low-level systems programming, and the ability to modify and extend existing system software.
