# Multi-Threaded Web Server with Shared Memory Statistics

## Project Overview
This project implements a multi-threaded web server in C, showcasing advanced systems programming concepts including thread synchronization, shared memory management, and inter-process communication. The server is designed to efficiently handle multiple concurrent HTTP requests and provide real-time performance statistics.

## Key Features and Implementations

### 1. Multi-Threading
- Implemented a fixed-size thread pool to handle concurrent HTTP requests efficiently.
- Utilized POSIX threads (pthreads) for creating and managing worker threads.
- Demonstrated understanding of thread lifecycle and management in a server environment.

### 2. Producer-Consumer Pattern
- Applied the producer-consumer pattern to manage incoming connections.
- Implemented a thread-safe circular buffer for connection descriptors.
- Used mutexes and condition variables for thread synchronization, ensuring thread-safe access to shared resources.

### 3. Shared Memory for Inter-Process Communication
- Utilized POSIX shared memory (shm_open, mmap) to create a shared statistics segment.
- Implemented a mechanism for worker threads to update request statistics in shared memory.
- Designed the system to allow an external process to read server statistics in real-time.

### 4. Signal Handling
- Implemented a custom signal handler for graceful server termination.
- Ensured proper cleanup of resources, including shared memory and synchronization primitives.

### 5. Performance Optimization
- Designed the server to minimize thread creation overhead by reusing threads from the pool.
- Implemented non-blocking I/O for accepting new connections, improving server responsiveness.

## Technical Highlights
- **Concurrency Control**: Demonstrated proficiency in using mutexes and condition variables for thread synchronization.
- **Memory Management**: Implemented careful management of shared memory resources.
- **Scalability**: Designed the server to efficiently handle varying loads by adjusting thread pool and buffer sizes.
- **Error Handling**: Incorporated robust error checking and handling throughout the implementation.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Advanced C programming
- Systems programming and OS concepts
- Concurrent programming and multi-threading
- Inter-process communication techniques
- Performance optimization for server applications

This project showcases my ability to design and implement complex, multi-threaded systems with a focus on performance, scalability, and reliability. It demonstrates my understanding of low-level system calls, thread synchronization mechanisms, and efficient server design principles, which are crucial skills for an SDE role in systems or backend development.
