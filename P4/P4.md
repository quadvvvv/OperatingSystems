# xv6 Kernel Memory Encryption Pager

This project extends the xv6 operating system to implement a kernel-managed memory encryption pager. The system keeps a fixed number of recently-accessed pages for each process stored in cleartext (decrypted), while encrypting less frequently used pages to enhance security.

## Key Features

1. **Page Encryption/Decryption**: Implemented system calls to encrypt and decrypt user pages on demand.
2. **Clock Algorithm**: Implemented a clock (FIFO with second chance) algorithm to manage a working set of decrypted pages for each process.
3. **Transparent Encryption**: New user pages start encrypted and are only decrypted when accessed, providing security by default.
4. **Working Set Management**: Maintains a fixed-size working set of decrypted pages per process, automatically managing page transitions between encrypted and decrypted states.
5. **System Call Interface**: Added new system calls (`mencrypt`, `getpgtable`, `dump_rawphymem`) to interact with the encrypted memory system.

## Implementation Highlights

- Modified `vm.c` to handle page encryption, decryption, and clock queue management.
- Updated `proc.c` to initialize and manage the clock queue for each process.
- Extended `syscall.c` and `sysproc.c` to implement new system calls for interacting with encrypted memory.
- Added `CLOCKSIZE` constant in `param.h` to define the working set size.

## Key Modifications

1. **Page Table Entries**: Used PTE bits to track encrypted pages and manage access.
2. **Trap Handling**: Modified the trap handler to decrypt pages on access.
3. **Process Management**: Updated `fork()`, `exec()`, and memory allocation/deallocation to handle encrypted pages correctly.
4. **Statistics and Debugging**: Implemented `getpgtable()` and `dump_rawphymem()` for introspection and debugging.

This project demonstrates an understanding of virtual memory systems, page table manipulation, and security-enhanced memory management in a Unix-like operating system.
